Machine Learning (ML) offers systems the ability to learn and improve experience without being explicitly programmed, accessing data and learning from their own experience.
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence, to perform various activities and can improve iterative based on the information they collect.Thus, the system can take decisions with minimal human interactions.

The motivation: The emotions are important because, they reflect the status of a subject and they allow you to analyze it’s reaction to certain stimuli. Emotions constantly characterizes us and detecting the types of emotion gives us the opportunity to observe the condition of others.

The Possible applications of my license project would be : Implementing the software in offices so that, the employer can detect the reaction of the employee when being at work or when receiving a task thus by analyzing it’s reactions , measures can be taken to improve the working atmosphere.

Another suitable application would be to implement the software in marketing so that the employer can observe the reaction of a customer when looking at a product or when looking at a price tag.

It could be used in the automation domain so that, for example :a car, can read the emotion of the driver and , when the driver is angry, to make the acceleration and the brake harder, to avoid the sudden acceleration or braking of the driver, to prevent a disaster.

The Purpose of the license work is to correctly identify the emotion of surprise of a person based on their facial expression mimics.

Contribution: The work implies the detection of the emotion of surprise in a photo taken from the video camera. This method implies the following mindset : Detect the face and the facial landmarks, crop the face, resize the face image, make the face image gray, split the face image in 49 cells, apply a feature extractor to get the details from the face image, create the histogram for the feature extractor, concatenate all the 49 cells for that we have extracted the features to remake the original photo, train the classifier and test the classifier in order to get a prediction. It is intended to implement a high accuracy recognition algorithm of surprise emotion based on facial analysis algorithms using machine learning and AI.

I have tested the algoritm for 78 subject, the conclusion being that, it scored 90.04% Accuracy

Working on the License project , I have learned the concept of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, how to work with them and I have improved my programming skills.
